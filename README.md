# Serial Replacer

Sometimes, in a text or code, we need to perform multiple replacements sequentially and repeat the process multiple times. Typically, each find-and-replace operation overwrites the previous one, forcing you to start over if you need to repeat the process. Wouldn't it be great to handle everything in structured stepsâ€”each replacement building on the last, so you never lose progress?
